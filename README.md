# imdbgame
I installed nodemon to make changes easier. 
I start with vanilla node.js then i saw it is too hard response requestes one by one by vanilla node.js then i decided to use express.js for this routes.
I decided to use .ejs html template engine to use html files and send datas to them easily.
I used bootstrap and https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/z8PZx card template thanks to evarevirus

i made IDScraper which scrap id's from a imdb link then scrap movie id's from it and put it in data object.

i added body parse to catch post requestes.

i dediced to use node-persist to save some data in local storage temprorary.
